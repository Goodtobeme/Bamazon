# Bamazon
Database for Purchasing Car Parts.

This is how Bamazon Works


The BamazonCustomer app lets a customer place an order from the store. There is a check on the inventory and the customer will be notified if their order can or cannot be completed or are shown the total amount owed. If the order is placed the quantity order is deducted from the store quantity and stored in the SQL table.
